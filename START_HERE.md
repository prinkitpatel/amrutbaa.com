## 🤔 Common Questions

### Do I need to know coding?
Not really! All major changes are documented in QUICK_REFERENCE.md. Just edit text in HTML file.

### Can I add a blog later?
Yes! It's just adding more HTML sections. We can help with that.

### What if something breaks?
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Revert to last working version (Git)
3. Cloudflare has automatic backups

### How do I collect payments?
For now, use batch registration → manual payment (UPI/bank transfer).
Later, integrate Razorpay or Stripe.

### Can this handle 1000s of orders?
Yes! Static sites scale infinitely. The only limit is your form backend (easily upgradable).
